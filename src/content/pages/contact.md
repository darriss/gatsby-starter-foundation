After studying abroad in Morocco during the Fall semester of 2019, I immediately knew that I wanted to have a longer and more intensive abroad experience in the future, challenging myself in new ways. Studying cultural anthropology is one of the main reasons I chose to become an International Studies major, yet one semester abroad did not satisfy my growing passion for cultural anthropology and transnational relations. However, two years immersed in cultural literacy and service would provide me with enough time to impact a community, invest myself in another culture, make life long connections, and gain clarity on my long term transnational career goals.
