I am currently a senior at Allegheny College, planned to graduate in 2021. While double majoring in Integrative Informatics and International Studies, my time at Allegheny consists of a variety of responsibilities and roles. Both my jobs on campus aim to make Allegheny a more inclusive place and ensure that students are civically engaged. I am also the Secretary for the Black Girl Magic Club, as well as helping out in other diversity focused groups on campus. In my free time I enjoy dancing, and have been a member of the Allegheny College Dance Team for four years. I am passionate about social change and civic engagement, hoping to join the Peace Corp one day.
