**Inclusivity and Equity Intern at Allegheny College**

In the admissions office I mainly assist admissions counselors in shaping a diverse and inclusive incoming class, conduct interviews with prospective students to see if they would be a good fit in the Allegheny community, and create presentations for prospective students to inform them on Alleghenyâ€™s various opportunities

**Field Manager in Grassroots Campaigns**

As a Field Manager I led canvasses, facilitated responsibilities to the canvass team, mobilized citizens for organizations such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, and defused high risk situations during the canvass. Over the course of my time with Grassroots, I individually raised over $2500 that paid for the legal fee's families at the Mexican-American border acquired and Planned Parenthood.

**Team Leader at Andrew Goodman Foundation**

Students in the Andrew Goodman Foundation register students on campus to vote, inform the student body of upcoming state and federal elections through various means of communication, and organize and mediate political debates on campus (with 20 - 30 students and faculty). This year was a hectic one for my team as we were registering students to vote during an election year.

**High School Ambassador at YMCA of the City of New York**

During my senior year, I worked my first job as an ambassador for the YWCA. In this role I led bystander prevention trainings for middle school girls to prevent school bullying, helped create a safe school environment, and educated youth about sexual harassment, and how to help victims before and after an altercation. I also helped maintain a safe space and inclusive environment for young women to share any traumatic experiences.

**Secretary of Black Girl Magic**

The mission of Black Girl Magic is to promote mental health and self care for women of color. As secretary I email members of BGM on upcoming events and sending out reminders, write up the minutes for all BGM board meetings, facilitate general body meetings, and help lead discussions.
