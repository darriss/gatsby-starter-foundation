### Why Morocco?

Growing up in New York City has provided me with continuous opportunities to serve my community, explore different cultures, and de-escalate conflicts amongst strangers of diverse backgrounds. I consider New York City to be a cultural melting pot, an environment where community service is ingrained daily, different languages can be heard on every block and globalization is present on every corner. As a product of my culturally fluid environment, I began to prioritize and value cultural diversity and civic engagement in my life. This is why I jumped at the possibility of studying in another country, becoming immersed in culture, traditions, and practices other than those that I encountered previously.

Being an International Studies major, my focus is in the Middle East and Northern African region, making Morocco the ideal country for my area of study. One reason I specifically wanted to study abroad in Morocco is because Arabic is one of the main languages spoken there. I wanted my Arabic to become more advanced which seemed more likely if I were to take it in an Arabic speaking country and speak with people in Arabic on a regular basis. Another benefit of studying abroad in Morocco was the opportunity to learn the history, culture, economic, and political systems of MENA countries from a North African viewpoint.

## My Study Abroad Experience

Studying in Morocco provided me with a non-Western perspective on a multitude of global issues. My experience in Morocco, as well as the languages I learned in the US (Spanish and Arabic) has helped me to see through a transnational lens that could be beneficial to my time in the Peace Corps. Studying abroad along with my work experience has prepared me for the challenges that come with serving. While I was in Morocco I learned to cope with homesickness while adapting to Moroccan culture, Islamic law, a new diet, as well as a huge language barrier. I still managed to travel throughout Morocco, conduct interviews with women in rural villages and soak up a breadth of knowledge on Arab traditions. I embraced foods, cultures, languages and ideologies I have never been exposed to while also rolling with the punches of attracting unwanted attention and getting harassed. Living in Morocco gave me the motivation to commit to a long term goal of mine, which is to educate young girls around the world so they have more career options, while also respecting their culture and religious practices.
