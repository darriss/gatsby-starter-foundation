Outside of work, I love to dance and crochet! I love crochetting so much that I made a [Crochet Website](http://fmhs-projects.net/Sammy/Week%203/home.html) in high school!

Dancing has always been a passion of mine! I have participated on the Dance Team, the Cheerleading Team, and a big dance production called Orchesis most of my time at Allegheny:
